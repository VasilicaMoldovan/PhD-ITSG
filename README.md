The 27 refactoring types considered are: Add Attribute Modifier, Add Method Annotation, Replace Anonymous With Lambda, Change Variable Type, Replace Loop With Pipeline, Add Attribute Annotation, Move Attribute, Merge Catch, Change Attribute Access Modifier, Extract Method, Remove Method Modifier, Change Parameter Type, Rename Method, Split Conditional, Change Return Type, Replace Variable With Attribute, Add Parameter Annotation, Move And Rename Class, Inline Method, Rename Parameter, Change Attribute Type, Push Down Attribute, Add Parameter, Change Method Access Modifier, Rename Attribute, Rename Variable, and Rename Class. The input of this application is either a .xlsx file resulted from as a static analysis report, or the app can be linked directly to SonarQube from which it takes the needed information for the specified project.
